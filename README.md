# August-Shutdown

Howdy
This is just a silly program that shows a picture of August and shuts down your computer after clicking the button...and that's it
I wanted to make this similar to the Peter Alert joke

DUE TO THE USE OF THE SHUTDOWN COMMAND, YOU MAY NEED TO RUN THE PROGRAM AS AN ADMINISTRATOR

That's about it. Enjoy :3
- August
